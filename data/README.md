# Data 

The fMRI responses and image stimuli used in our experiments were made publicly available by the authors of [Pereira et al.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03068-4) More specifically, stimuli and fMRI responses can he found [here](https://osf.io/crwz7/). For the metadata of the `.mat` files containing the fMRI responses and links to single-participant fMRI responses, see also [here](https://web.mit.edu/evlab//sites/default/files/documents/index2.html). 

Note that there may be discrepancies between the sentences included in the OSF repository and those reported in `screen_sentences.csv`. We ensured that the sentences from `screen_sentences.csv` were exactly those seen by participants.
